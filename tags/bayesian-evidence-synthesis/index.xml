      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bayesian evidence synthesis (BES) provides a method to aggregate support from independent studies, without a need for harmonization of the data itself. With BES, the relative probability of a set of hypotheses is evaluated for each separate dataset. Only thereafter, the relative evidence is aggregated to find out which hypothesis is supported by all datasets simultaneously and is a measure of robust support. In the papers linked to this project, I applied this procedure to aggregate evidence from multiple cohort studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below you find a +/- 3-minute video that I made about a publication on BES with longitudinal data.
